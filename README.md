# My-Data-Science-Projects

Welcome to my repo `My-Data-Science-Projects`. This repo contains the data science projects that
I have worked so far. There are various topics in the projects including scientific computing,
geotechnical research, civil engineering, health and finance. The computational methods
incorporated in the projects are varied as well, including the following:
- Mathematical modelling.
- Numeric optimization.
- Machine learning implementations.

Most of the projects are machine learning implementations.
