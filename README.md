# My-Data-Science-Projects

Welcome to my repo `My-Data-Science-Projects`. This repo contains the data science projects that
I have worked so far. There are various topics in the projects including scientific computing,
geotechnical research, civil engineering, health and finance. The computational methods
incorporated in the projects are varied as well, including the following:
- Mathematical modelling.
- Numeric optimization.
- Machine learning implementations.

Most of the projects are machine learning implementations.

1. [**Market Demand Analysis: Sales Forecast of a Coffee Shop Chain in the US**](/market-demand-analysis-a-coffee-shop-chain-in-us.ipynb)

   In this project, we analyse a sales dataset from a coffee shop chain in the US, available
   in Kaggle's public datasets. We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and demand
   forecasting for the coffee shop, which is valuable for potential product portfolio optimisation.
   Several techniques from data analysis, statistics, and pure mathematics are leveraged in the process,
   highlighting the intricate interplay between abstract mathematics, computational methods,
   and market demand analysis. One of the key results of our analysis is that the demand for
   the products by the coffee shop chain is expected to increase by an average of 102.53% over
   the next six months. While the dataset provides valuable insights, it is important to note
   that its reliability may vary. Instead of focusing solely on the dataset's accuracy,
   this work demonstrates a unique blended multidisciplinary approach for market demand analysis
   with an emphasis on the methodology.

2. [**Forecasting PM2.5 Concentration on South Jakarta Air**](/South_Jakarta_Air_Quality.ipynb)

   In this project, we perform a time series analysis on a dataset of Air Quality in South Jakarta
   imported from OpenAQ API. We analyse temporal patterns in the dataset and we perform a short
   period forecast using machine learning (ML) models as well as our package
   [AbstrakTS](https://github.com/rizalpurnawan23/AbstrakTS).

3. [**Apple Stock Price Forecast**](/apple-stock-price-forecast.ipynb)

   In this project, we will perform a forecasting on Apple Inc. stock price for the 182 days ahead
   (6 months). The original dataset can be personally downloaded from
   [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aapl/historical).
   We will also demonstrate the implementation of a newly developed Python package for handling
   time series forecasting called [AbstrakTS](https://github.com/rizalpurnawan23/AbstrakTS).

4. [**Concrete Strength Analysis**](/concrete-strength-analysis-eda-ml-model.ipynb)

   In this project, we will analyse a concrete data set which consists of material compositions
   as features and the concrete strength data. First we analyse the relation of the features
   as well as the realation between each feature with the strength. Then we build a machine
   learning model to predict the strength of given concrete compositions.

5. [**Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis**](/heart-disease-analysis-eda.ipynb)

   In this project, we perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of heart disease.
   In the analysis, we uncover the most-likely factors correlated with heart disease.

6. [**House Price Prediction**](/house_prediction_xgboost.ipynb)

   In this project, we develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on a
   dataset of house prices. We implement `XGBRegressor` algorithm from `xgboost` library for the
   ML model.

7. [**Nvidia Stock Price Forecast**](/nvidia-stock-price-forecast.ipynb)

   In this project, we perform a time series analysis on a dataset of Nvidia stock prices.
   We build a machine learning (ML) model for performing forecast on the stock price.

8. [**Geotechnical Research Projects**](/Geotechnical-Research)

   In this directory, we present our research project in geotechnical engineering incorporating
   mathematical modelling, data analysis and machine learning implementations.
