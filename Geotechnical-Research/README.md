# **About Geotechnical Engineering Research Projects**

Welcome to the directory of `Geotechnical-Research`. This directory, which is part of `My-Data-Science-Projects`,
contains my research projects in Geotechnical Engineering which incorporate machine learning algorithms.
I will usually build the underlying mathematical frameworks of the computations or the frameworks describing the
directions of the research.

### 1. ML-Driven Solution to the Lateral Pile Capacity for Long Piles in Geotechnical Engineering

This research focuses on an innovative method for estimating lateral pile capacity in geotechnical engineering,
building upon the theoretical groundwork laid by ([Broms, 1964a](https://doi.org/10.1061/JSFEAQ.0000611) and
[Broms, 1964b](https://doi.org/10.1061/JSFEAQ.0000614)) and further generalized by
[(Cecconi et. al, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sandf.2019.01.007). Traditionally, estimating the lateral pile
capacity of long piles involves solving higher-degree polynomials, a method deemed impractical. In response,
we propose a numeric solution by employing a machine learning (ML) model trained on data generated from corresponding
polynomial equations to estimate the lateral pile capacity. The theoretical framework of the ML model is presented,
along with key performance evaluation parameters. Our results demonstrate that the ML model achieves considerable
accuracy, offering a time-effective alternative to the conventional method of solving higher-degree polynomials.
